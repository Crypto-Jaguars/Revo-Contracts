# Purchase Review Contract 📝

A smart contract for managing purchase reviews on the Stellar blockchain.

## Overview 🎯

The Purchase Review Contract enables users to create, manage, and verify product purchase reviews in a decentralized manner. It ensures authenticity of reviews by linking them to actual purchases and provides a transparent review system.

## Features ✨

- Secure review submission tied to purchases
- Review verification system
- Review management capabilities
- Transparent and immutable review history

## Contract Interface 🔧

```rust
pub trait IPurchaseReviewContractTrait {
    fn create_review(&self, product_id: String, rating: u8, comment: String) -> Result<bool, Error>;
    fn get_review(&self, review_id: String) -> Result<Review, Error>;
    fn verify_review(&self, review_id: String) -> Result<bool, Error>;
}
```

## Setup Instructions 🚀

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Rust toolchain
   - Stellar SDK
   - Soroban CLI

2. **Installation**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone [repository-url]

   # Navigate to the contract directory
   cd IPurchaseReviewContract

   # Build the contract
   cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
   ```

## Usage Examples 💡

### Creating a Review
```rust
let review = contract.create_review(
    "product123".to_string(),
    5,
    "Excellent product!".to_string()
);
```

### Retrieving a Review
```rust
let review = contract.get_review("review123".to_string());
```

### Verifying a Review
```rust
let is_verified = contract.verify_review("review123".to_string());
```

## Testing 🧪

Run the contract tests using:
```bash
cargo test
```

## Contract States 📊

The contract maintains the following states:
- Review Storage
- Verification Status
- Purchase Links

## Security Considerations 🔒

- Review submission requires valid purchase proof
- Review modifications are restricted
- Verification process is tamper-proof
